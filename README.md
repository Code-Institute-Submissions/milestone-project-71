# [Mix and Cheers](https://cocktails-recipes.herokuapp.com/)

Milestone Project 3: Data-Centric Development - Code Institute

[Mix and Cheers](https://cocktails-recipes.herokuapp.com/) is a website that allows the users to easily access, store and manage cocktails recipes.

The main functionalities of the website include: 

- Searching, adding, editing and deleting cocktail recipes.
- Adding, editing and deleting cocktail categories.
- Find information related to bartending field and also purchase products/services.

## UX

My goal in the design was to create a fresh, dynamic, responsive and user-friendly website, where all cocktail lovers could come together to share their recipes.

The website consists of five main sections: Recipes, Add Recipe, Categories, Search and Start Mixing; where the users can easily navigate and try the website's functionalities.

As the site's owner, another goal was to promote bartending products/services and earn money by including affiliate links where potential customers could buy from. All these links are located in the 'Start Mixing' area of the navigation bar.

### User Stories

### Design (Mockups)

The original design of the application was represented with Mockups. Click [here](https://github.com/fredveloper/milestone-project-3/tree/master/doc) to see the mockups.

## Features

### Existing Features

## Testing

### Manual Test

The website has a fully responsive design. This was tested through different web browsers: Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer. 

The website pages are displaying and working correctly on different screen sizes for Google Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge. 

Even though the website is also displaying correctly in Internet Explorer, the flipping cards are not fully functional, since their back areas are not showing up when clicking the 'View Recipe' button. Therefore, it is not recommended to use Internet Explorer to access this project.

A manual test was done for every single page to evaluate the website's functionality. All the forms, buttons, links and functions were checked.

- **All Pages**

    The navigation bar and footer elements (fonts, icons, links, dropdown menu) are displaying correctly and all the links are redirecting to the correct locations.

- **Recipes.html**

    - Search Area:
    
        The search input field and the search button are working correctly and the result is displayed according to the user's search.

    - Flipping Cards:

        The flipping cards elements (image, text, buttons) are displaying correctly. All the buttons are responding according to the action executed (view recipe, go back, edit, delete) and are redirecting to the correct locations.

- **AddRecipe.html and AddCategory.html**

    - Forms:
        - All elements are displaying correctly.
        - The form is successfully processed when all the required fields are filled in. 
        - The form is not being processed when a required field is left blank. In this case, an alert message is displayed to the user to indicate the required fields.
        - The buttons are responding according to the action executed (save, delete)

- **EditRecipe.html and EditCategory.html**

    - Forms:
        - All elements are displaying correctly.
        - All the fields are populated according to the recipe/category selected for edition.
        - The form is successfully processed when all the required fields are filled in. 
        - The form is not being processed when a required field is left blank. In this case, an alert message is displayed to the user to indicate the required fields.
        - The buttons are responding according to the action executed (save, delete)

- **Categories.html**

    - Table:

        - The stored categories are presented in a table and all its elements are displaying correctly.
        - The buttons are responding according to the action executed (save, delete)

### Code Validation

All the files were inspected using the below validators:

- [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) for the HTML files.
- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) for the CSS files.
